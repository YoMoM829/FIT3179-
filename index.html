                Energy exists around us <br>
                It exists in Plants and Humans as biochemical energy <br>
                It exists as Solar Energy from the Sun and as Chemical Energy in Coal <br>
                It is all around us and used to power all the large technologies of the World<br>

                And How <span style="font-weight: bold;">much is consumed?</span><br>
                How much does Australia <span style="font-weight: bold;">profit from Energy?</span><br>

                        It can be see that when

                        is pretty evenly used in each State suggesting 
                        there may be similar reserves of OIl in each state.

                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Coal</span> is quite concentrated to the right of Australia
                        with NSW having the largest usage of around 29.24% and NT having the least with 0%.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Renewables</span> are clearly heavily used in 
                        Tasmania with a usage of 45.46%. Whilst South Australia is around 18.56%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Gas</span> is heavily used in the 
                        left parts of Australia. This is mainly due to large reserves that exist in those 
                        areas. This offers a lot of jobs. The trend that can be seen in the right parts of
                        Australia is that there are few usages of Gas. This is due to the fact that
                        a lot of Gas projects are being discontinued in order to reduce emissions and 
                        meet climate change goals.

                When it comes to Australia, it has a population of  
                <span style="font-size: 50px;"> 26.01</span> million. 
                This is quite a small population given the size of Australia.
                However, Australia is a Developed country and quite technologically 
                advanced compared to most other countries. In fact, Australia is the
                <span style="font-size: 50px;"> 20th</span>
                largest consumer of Energy on the Planet.

                        Coal is the energy source used to produce the most energy for 
                        Australia. 
                        Whilst Renewables is the least produced.
                        This is because Coal is 
                        the most abundant source energy resource in Australia and is often mined 
                        the most.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Renewables have only been propped in the last 3 or so decades
                        as more concern has been brought about the environmental impact of 
                        energy. Though given the current pressure on Climate Change, in the future,
                        Renewables increase in energy production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gas and Oil do not seem to contribute to much to Energy production.
                        This is due to the fact that Coal outputs more energy per KG. It is more
                        energy efficient and it can be safer to excavate and mine in comparison 
                        to Gas.

                        The following chart analyses how much energy is consumed or used by 
                        different fuel types. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A similar trend is seen in the line chart above where Coal seems 
                        to be resource where the energy produced from it is consumed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it is shown that Oil is actually larger in comparison. Ironically,
                        Coal should be the largest contributor to Energy Consumption as the 
                        Energy Produced by Coal should be the Energy Consumed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does hold True is that Renewables contribute the least since they have 
                        only recently been introduced into the Australian Energy Sector.

                    Due to the large amount of resources, 
                    Australia is one of the biggest exporters

                        it can be seen that in 1983, Coal was the largest export and 
                        remains to be all the way to 2020 however, Gas, which was not 
                        exported until 1989 now becomes the second largest export. 
                        Refined Petroleum products are the lowest export given that
                        it is in short supply.

                        Oil and Refined Petroleum Products are the biggest exports primarly Oil.
                        However overtime, Gas has become a new import and Refined Petroleum Products
                        have become the biggest imports demonstrating the connection between the two graphs,

                            The three largest being Electricity Supply, Manufacturing, and Transport.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These are the three biggest given that Electricity Supply refers to the supply of electricity to homes, 
                            which is high due to the vast amount of uses of technology. 
                            Transport is high in energy consumption given the number of people who use Public transport to commute
                            to and from work. 
                            Manufacturing is high since a lot of machines are used to make products, 
                            and these machines require a lot of power.
