                When it comes to Australia, it has a population of 26.01 million. 
                This is actually quite a small population given the size of Australia.
                However, Australia is a Developed country and quite technologically 
                advanced comapred to most other countries. In fact, Australia is the
                <span style="font-size: 50px;">20th</span>
                largest consume of Energy on the Planet.
                Additionally, Australia is the
                <span style="font-size: 50px;">15th</span>
                in terms of per capita energy

                    Coal is the energy source used to produce the most energy for 
                    Australia. 
                    Whilst Renewables is the least produced.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This is because Coal is 
                    the most abundant source energy resource in Australia and is often mined 
                    the most.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Renewables have only been propped in the last 3 or so decades
                    as more concern has been brought about the environmental impact of 
                    energy.

                    A similar trend is seen in the line chart above where Coal seems 
                    to be resource where the energy produced from it is consumed.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    However, it is shown that Oil is actually larger in comparison. Ironically,
                    Coal should be the largest contributor to Energy Consumption as the 
                    Energy Produced by Coal should be the Energy Consumed.

                    <Br>
                    What does hold True is that Renewables contribute the least since they have 
                    only recently been introduced into the Australian Energy Sector.

                        it can be seen that in 1983, Coal was the largest export and 
                        remains to be all the way to 2020 however, Gas, which was not 
                        exported until 1989 now becomes the second largest export. 
                        Refined Petroleum products are the lowest export given that
                        it is in short supply.

                        Oil and Refined Petroleum Products are the biggest exports primarly Oil.
                        However overtime, Gas has become a new import and Refined Petroleum Products
                        have become the biggest imports demonstrating the connection between the two graphs,
